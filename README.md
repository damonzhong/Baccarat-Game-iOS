## MVC: 
  -  The baccarat table as a whole is used as the view
  -  The betting table is the model which updates the controller
  -  The controller in this project is the "Baccarat Dealer" that handles distributing and deducting bet amounts for the user

## Specific features:
  - the purpose was to have the betting feel close to real life
  - It was important to me to have the drag and drop feature to imitate the feeling on placing bets with chips
  - This was acomplished through the use of pan gestures
