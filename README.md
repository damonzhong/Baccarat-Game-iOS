# Baccarat-Game-iOS
Simple single page Baccarat game created with MVC design archiecture

# Version of XCode
XCode Version 11.1

# Simulator:
iPhone 11 Pro Max 

## Proposal: 
  I intend to create a Baccarat game 
  
  must have features:
  - Button for each casino chip 
  - Betting options of 5,10,25 dollar casino chips
  - Pop last chip placed as a bet before round starts
  - Ability to drag and drop betting amounts to sum to total bet amount before round starts
  - Animations that "pop" when tapping/holding down casino chips
  - Show total currency available
  - Show last round earnings
  
  Nice to have features:
  - Animations for the cards displayed - flip, slide onto screen

## Game functions:
  The game right now is quite simple
  - To place a bet, tap/click hold the chip image then drag and drop onto a bet container 
  - To clear the bets in the container, press "CLEAR"
  - To start the game press "START" button
  
## Specific features:
  My must features were to implement the betting function.
  - the purpose was to have the betting feel close to real life
  - It was important to me to have the drag and drop feature
  - This was acomplished through the use of pan gestures
  
## Diffculties along the way:
  I struggled in the beginning to implement my must have feature of drag and drop
  - I first tried dragging and dropping images which was not the function or feature for this project
  - That was more for dragging and dropping images onto a view, which might be what I need to implement some future improvements to my game
  - With the given amount of time I was not able to implement constraints for my views, which I feel terrible about
  - I really wanted to make sure the game logic was working correctly along with the betting system.
  - The drag and drop, and animations for the overall UI took a lot of time, especially when faced with bugs 
  
## What I learned:
  While working on this project I got a really good feel for storyboard vs coding. I started out purely on storyboard, then when I needed to do more specific task I ended up coding a lot of the views. 
  - With more experience I might end up wanting to do all the views in code with a Preview View. For now I am using a hybrid approach.
  - Making apps are quite enjoyable through Swift, although I this is my first time creating an app. Objective C would have been a beast to     tackle
  
## Future Improvements to the game:
  - Features to add is chart as a container view at the top horizontally that displays and keeps track of winners from each round
  - Also, adding another view to display the chart in full
  - Other UI features to add are displaying each chip added for the bet container 
  - Some UX, A notification for when the round is over the winner  - More betting options: bet all, Panda and Dragon
  - Home screen UI 
  - Database to store user’s  Total cash
  
## Final Thoughts:
  - I learnt what it takes to build an iOS app
  - Signing up for this class I had no idea that this was an iOS app development class.
  - To my pleasure this is a skills I wanted to learn
  - Lectures were done extremely well with the explainations of details that will benefit programming in Swift
  - Building an iOS game has been a passion project for me and I enjoyed this very much
